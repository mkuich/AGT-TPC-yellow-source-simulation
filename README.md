# AGT-TPC-yellow-source-simulation
This repository contains the simplest simulation of the alpha particle source (so-called yellow source) used in ATG-TPC projects (ex. CHICKEN2).
Simulated source consists of three different isotopes (Am-243, Am-241, Cm-243) emitting alpha particles of kinetic energy 5-6 MeV.
Alpha particles ranges and struggling (x and y) were simulated for different gas (CO2) pressures with SRIM tool.
Source (and its isotipes) activity was measured with Si detektor.
